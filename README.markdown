Introduction
------------

This is just a small Lua module, named help, that does three things:

- Provides a way to record documentation for code, in the code: based on
the ideas from <http://lua-users.org/wiki/DecoratorsAndDocstrings>

- Provides a "help()" function to look up documentation for arbitrary
Lua objects, intended for "end user" use.

- Allows connection to other lua systems, like Luabind and osgLua,
that provide their own methods of introspective help, for seamless
use with "help()"

See the `examples.lua` and `test.lua` files for some instructive examples.
Naturally, you can (and are encouraged to) do the following in your Lua interpreter:

    require("help")
    help(help)

That separate project can (and probably does) have its own license specifics.
