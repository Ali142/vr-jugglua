Given a node and a function, creates an action for the node to perform.

Actions.addFrameAction = help.docstring[[
Given a function, start an action. Your function will be run, and
you will be responsible for calling Actions.waitForRedraw() once you
are done executing for a single display frame.

Your action will be removed when it finishes (goes to the end or returns),
or sooner if you use Actions.removeFrameAction.

Returns an object referring to your action - only useful to remove it.
If you don't plan on removing the action before it completes, you don't
need to hang on to this value.

Remove a frame action, stopping it from executing, presumably prior to
its natural exit.

Actions.waitForRedraw = help.docstring[[
Pauses an action momentarily to update the display. This must be called frequently:
changes will not be seen until it is called.

If you pass a number, it will wait for that many redraws. By default, it
only waits once.

Returns the amount of time that it waited, in seconds.

Actions.updateFrameActions = help.docstring[[
Run all frame actions until they wait for the next redraw. This
should be placed preferably in the latePreFrame section of the application
delegate.

If that made no sense to you, you do not need to use this function.

If you are implementing your own application delegate, call this method
before adding any actions, and pass the value you got from vrjApp.OsgAppProxy().
