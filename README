VR JuggLua
----------

Lua bindings and high-level interface for virtual experience creation, built on VR Juggler

Dependencies:
-------------
 - CMake 2.6 or newer (tested mainly with 2.8.1) - build system generator
 - Boost 1.34 or newer (1.35 better, newer even better)
 - VR Juggler 2.2.x (2.2.2 or newer recommended), built against Boost 1.34 or newer
 - OpenSceneGraph, including osgIntrospection/wrappers (2.8.x tested)

LuaBind, osgLua, and Lua 5.1.4 are included in the source tree and integrated
in to the build - you do not need to build these separately.
